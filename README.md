🌟 **Welcome to the Weather App!** 🌟  
It is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) using asynchronous JavaScript (fetch). The app dynamically updates the user interface based on API responses, displaying temperature, weather conditions, and location-specific details.🌎
